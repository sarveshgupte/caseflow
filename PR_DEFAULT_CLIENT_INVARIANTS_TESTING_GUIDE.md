# Testing Guide: Default Client Invariants PR

## 🧪 Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the Default Client invariants implementation. All acceptance criteria must be verified before deployment.

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Access
- Admin account credentials
- Access to API testing tool (Postman, curl, or browser DevTools)
- Access to application frontend
- Optional: Database access for verification

### Test Environment
- Backend API running on configured port (default: 5000)
- Frontend application running
- MongoDB connected with test data
- Default Client (C000001) exists in database

## 🔍 Test Scenarios

### Test Group 1: Backend API Validation

#### Test 1.1: Prevent Default Client Deactivation
**Objective:** Verify API blocks deactivation of C000001

**Steps:**
1. Get admin authentication token
2. Send PATCH request to deactivate C000001

**cURL Command:**
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/clients/C000001/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"isActive": false}'
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Default client cannot be deactivated."
}
```

**HTTP Status:** 400 Bad Request

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- Returns 400 status code
- Returns error message: "Default client cannot be deactivated."
- Database status remains ACTIVE for C000001

---

#### Test 1.2: Allow Default Client Activation (Edge Case)
**Objective:** Verify activation is allowed (though it should always be active)

**Steps:**
1. Attempt to activate C000001 (should succeed as no-op)

**cURL Command:**
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/clients/C000001/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"isActive": true}'
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "clientId": "C000001",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    ...
  },
  "message": "Client activated successfully"
}
```

**HTTP Status:** 200 OK

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- Returns 200 status code
- Status remains ACTIVE
- No error thrown

---

#### Test 1.3: Allow Other Client Deactivation
**Objective:** Verify non-default clients can still be deactivated

**Prerequisite:** Create test client (not C000001)

**Steps:**
1. Get a non-default client ID (e.g., C000002)
2. Deactivate the client

**cURL Command:**
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/clients/C000002/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"isActive": false}'
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "clientId": "C000002",
    "status": "INACTIVE",
    ...
  },
  "message": "Client deactivated successfully"
}
```

**HTTP Status:** 200 OK

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- Returns 200 status code
- Status changed to INACTIVE
- isActive changed to false

---

#### Test 1.4: Get Clients for Create Case
**Objective:** Verify forCreateCase parameter always includes Default Client

**Test Case A - Default Client is Active:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/clients?forCreateCase=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected:** C000001 included in results

**Test Case B - Default Client is Inactive (Manual DB Edit):**
1. Manually set C000001 status to INACTIVE in database
2. Run same query

**Expected:** C000001 STILL included in results

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- C000001 always present in response
- Other clients included only if ACTIVE
- Results sorted by clientId

## 📝 Notes

### Known Limitations
- Pre-existing issue: Rate limiting not implemented (not in scope)
- Manual database edits could theoretically set C000001 to INACTIVE, but API prevents it

### Test Data Cleanup
After testing, ensure:
- Reset any manually changed statuses
- Remove test clients if created
- Verify C000001 is ACTIVE

### Performance Testing
Not required for this PR, but consider:
- Load testing with many concurrent client requests
- Database query performance with large client lists
